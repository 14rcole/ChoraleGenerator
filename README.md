# ChoraleGenerator
Generates chorales in the style of Bach based on baroque rules of four part writing.

# A few notes
Unfortunately, I lost the most recent version of the project so when I finally decided to upload this, I had to use an old one.  I don't believe that all of the features are implemented but what I know works is listed below.  I'll fill in the rest in the coming weeks.

# What works
-Bass Generation <br />
-Soprano Generation <br />
-Output to MIDI <br />
-Output to audio (.wav) <br />
-Output to lilypond file <br />

# Dependencies
The user's system must have the following: <br />
-ffmpeg <br />
-lilypond <br />
